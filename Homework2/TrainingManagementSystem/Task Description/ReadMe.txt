Task 2. Coherent is developing a training management system. Each training consists of a set of
lectures and practical exercises. It is necessary to create classes to represent the following
entities: training, lecture, practical lesson.
All specified entities have a text description (this is an arbitrary string, possibly empty or equal
to null).
A lecture has a topic (an arbitrary string, possibly empty or equal to null), practical lesson - a
link to a task condition (an arbitrary string, possibly empty or equal to null) and a link to a
solution (an arbitrary string, possibly empty or equal to null).
The training should store a set of lectures and practice letures in an internal array and have an
Add() method for adding a lecture or practice session. In addition, the training must have an
IsPractical() method - it returns true if the training contains only practical lessons.
Implement the Clone() instance method in the training class to clone the training.

Caution: Deep cloning should be performed, not shallow cloning.
Test the classes in a console application.
